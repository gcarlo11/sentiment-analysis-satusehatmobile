# ü©∫ Sentiment Analysis of SATUSEHAT Mobile App Reviews

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on user reviews of the **SATUSEHAT Mobile** application ‚Äî Indonesia‚Äôs national health platform.
The main objective is to classify each review into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiment categories using **machine learning** techniques.

Two models are developed and compared:

* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Na√Øve Bayes (MultinomialNB)**

The project also addresses **class imbalance** with the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** and visualizes the most frequent words per sentiment using **WordClouds**.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset was **self-scraped** from the **Google Play Store** and stored as `satusehat_reviews.csv`.
Each entry contains:

* The review text
* A corresponding star rating (1‚Äì5)

Sentiment labels are derived as follows:

* **Positive (positif):** 4‚Äì5 stars
* **Neutral (netral):** 3 stars
* **Negative (negatif):** 1‚Äì2 stars

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a **standard machine learning pipeline** for text classification in Indonesian:

### 1. Data Loading

* Load the dataset using **pandas** and inspect for missing or duplicate entries.

### 2. Labeling

* Convert numerical ratings into categorical sentiment labels (`positif`, `netral`, `negatif`).

### 3. Text Preprocessing

Raw review text is cleaned and standardized through:

* **Cleansing:** Remove non-alphanumeric characters and punctuation.
* **Case Folding:** Convert text to lowercase.
* **Tokenization:** Split sentences into individual words.
* **Stopword Filtering:** Remove common Indonesian stopwords via `nltk`.
* **Stemming:** Reduce words to their root form using the **Sastrawi** stemmer.

### 4. Feature Extraction

* Apply **TF‚ÄìIDF vectorization** to transform preprocessed text into numerical features representing word importance.

### 5. Handling Class Imbalance

* Since positive reviews dominate, apply **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic samples of minority classes for balanced model training.

### 6. Model Training and Evaluation

Two supervised models are trained and compared:

* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with linear kernel
* **Na√Øve Bayes (MultinomialNB)**

Models are evaluated using:

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **F1-score**
* **Confusion Matrix**

### 7. Visualization

* **WordClouds** illustrate the most frequent terms per sentiment class, providing qualitative insights into user feedback trends.

## üìä Results

| Model           | Accuracy   | Remarks                                                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SVM**         | **0.9417** | Achieved high precision and recall across all classes, performing best on ‚Äúneutral‚Äù and ‚Äúpositive‚Äù sentiments. |
| **Na√Øve Bayes** | **0.8842** | Delivered solid results but slightly lower overall accuracy than SVM.                                          |

### üî§ WordCloud Insights

* **Positive** reviews include words about *good service, ease of use, and helpful features*.
* **Negative** reviews highlight issues such as *bugs, login problems, and slow performance*.
